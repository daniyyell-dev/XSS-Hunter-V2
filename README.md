Chrome Extension for XSS Hunter Payloads

This takes all of the payloads from <a href="https://xsshunter.com" target="_blank">XSS Hunter</a> and puts them into an easily accessible Chrome extension.

This application is still under development, so suggestions for cleaning/optimizing code are greatly appreciated.
